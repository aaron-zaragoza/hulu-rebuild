# Technologies
React, HTML, CSS, Javascipt, Firebase, Axios, Material-UI

# Challenges
I am currently looking to resolve an issue that causes the banner on the movie selection screen to sometimes render with no data (no image). I have speculated that I am simply pulling a blank entry from the API, but the investigation continues.

# Moving Forward
I plan to make all buttons functional and potentially developing the back end in the near future, thus allowing for personalized content and themes to enhance the user experience. I also intend to display a playable trailer for each movie selection, once clicked. Please stay tuned as these additional features roll out and I look forward to sharing updates!
